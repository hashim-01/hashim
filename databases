Relational Databases:
Data is organized into tables with rows and columns.
Relationships between tables are defined using primary and foreign keys.
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server
NoSQL Databases:
More flexible data models than relational databases, often handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase
Object-Oriented Databases:
Store data in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming languages.
Examples: ObjectDB, Objectivity/DB
Hierarchical Databases:
Organize data in a tree-like structure, with a parent-child relationship between records.
